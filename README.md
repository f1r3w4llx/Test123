**Crypto26** is a command-line tool developed by **f1r3w4llx**.  
It allows you to **encrypt and decrypt messages** using both **symmetric** and **asymmetric** methods, and also includes a **custom encryption algorithm** designed specifically for this project!  
Additionally, Crypto26 supports **hashing functions**, making it an all-in-one solution for message security.
